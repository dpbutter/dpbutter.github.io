      <description>About me  I was born in Pittsburgh, PA, did my undergrad in Chemistry &amp;amp; Physics at Harvard University in Cambridge, MA, and went on to graduate school in theoretical physics at the University of California at Berkeley. I grew enamored with supersymmetric and supergravity theories, and this took me all over the world. First, I went down under to work with Sergei Kuzenko at the University of Western Australia in Perth, and then to Amsterdam, where I worked with Bernard de Wit at Nikhef.</description>

      <description>Here is a list of my publications and preprints. They can also be found either on inspire-HEP, on the arXiv, or via Google Scholar. Note that in high energy physics, it is conventional to place authors in alphabetical order.
Publications K. Becker, D. Butter, and A. Sengupta, Linearized Off-shell 4+7 Supergeometry of 11D Supergravity, To appear in JHEP. arXiv:2207.14327. D. Butter, Exploring the geometry of supersymmetric double field theory, JHEP 01 (2022) 152 arXiv:2101.</description>
